 🧹 Image Denoising: Self-Guided vs Gaussian Filter
This project demonstrates two methods for reducing noise in images:

🔹 Gaussian Filter
A traditional, widely used linear filter that smooths the image by averaging pixel values with a Gaussian kernel. It's effective for general noise reduction but may blur edges.

🔹 Self-Guided Filter
An edge-preserving filter that adapts based on local image structures. It maintains sharper details and edges while still reducing noise, offering better performance in many visual applications compared to standard methods.

🖼️ Results
Below are comparison results showing the effect of both filters on the same noisy image:
